# SQL Practice Using PostgreSQL

Welcome to my learning journey in SQL using PostgreSQL! This repository documents my hands-on experience and progress as I explore the fundamentals and advanced features of SQL. My learning track is structured to cover essential SQL commands and concepts.<br>

> I believe in learning by doing. Throughout this journey, I am working on practical examples, real-world scenarios, and hands-on projects to reinforce my understanding. Exercises and projects accompany each topic to apply the concepts learned and build a solid foundation in SQL using PostgreSQL.<br>


### 1. SQL Commands :

- **Data Definition Language** (DDL), Learn how to define and manage database ``schema``, including commands like ``CREATE``, ``ALTER``, and ``DROP``. <br>
- **Data Query Language** (DQL), Focus on querying the database using ``SELECT`` statements to retrieve data.<br>
- **Transaction Control Language** (TCL), Understand how to control transactions using ``COMMIT``, ``ROLLBACK``, and ``SAVEPOINT``.<br>
- **Data Manipulation Language** (DML), Get hands-on with inserting, updating, deleting, and managing data using ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``, and ``MERGE``.<br>
- **Data Control Language** (DCL), Learn about managing access permissions using ``GRANT`` and ``REVOKE``.<br>

### 2. Data Types :
- Explore the various data types available in PostgreSQL, understanding their use cases and how to implement them effectively.

### 3. Normalization :
- Understand the database normalization principles to design efficient and logical database structures. Learn about different normal forms and their applications.

### 4. Views :
- Learn how to create and use views to simplify complex queries, improve security, and present data meaningfully.

### 5. Joins :
- Master the various types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables and derive meaningful insights.
