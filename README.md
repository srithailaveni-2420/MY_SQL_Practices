# MY_SQL_Practices

Welcome to my learning journey in SQL using PostgreSQL! This repository documents my hands-on experience and progress as I explore the fundamentals and advanced features of SQL. My learning track is structured to cover essential SQL commands and concepts.<br>

>  *Check out My [`Roadmap`](https://harmonious-seer-e8e.notion.site/Data-Scientist-Roadmap-08afdb4e3bb24a769b6a097c294098d2) to become a Data Scientist! I'm following this plan to level up my skills and excel in the fieldâœ¨.*


### 1. SQL Commands 

- Data Definition Language (DDL): Learn how to define and manage database ``schema``, including commands like ``CREATE``, ``ALTER``, and ``DROP``. <br>
- Data Query Language (DQL): Focus on querying the database using ``SELECT`` statements to retrieve data.<br>
- Transaction Control Language (TCL): Understand how to control transactions using ``COMMIT``, ``ROLLBACK``, and ``SAVEPOINT``.<br>
- Data Manipulation Language (DML): Get hands-on with inserting, updating, deleting, and managing data using ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``, and ``MERGE``.<br>
- Data Control Language (DCL): Learn about managing access permissions using ``GRANT`` and ``REVOKE``.<br>

### 2. Data Types
- Explore the various data types available in PostgreSQL, understanding their use cases and how to implement them effectively.

### 3. Normalization :
- Understand the principles of database normalization to design efficient and logical database structures. Learn about different normal forms and their applications.

### 4. Views :
- Learn how to create and use views to simplify complex queries, improve security, and present data in a meaningful way.

### 5. Joins :
- Master the various types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables and derive meaningful insights.

### My Learning Approach :
> I believe in learning by doing. Throughout this journey, I am working on practical examples, real-world scenarios, and hands-on projects to reinforce my understanding. Each topic is accompanied by exercises and projects to apply the concepts learned and build a solid foundation in SQL using PostgreSQL.
